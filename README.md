Dear reader,

I am a first-year biophysics masterâ€™s student at Sorbonne University currently undertaking an internship under the supervision of Dr. Genevieve Thon, a biologist at the Department of Biology of the University of Copenhagen (UCPH), and Dr. Kim Sneppen, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute of UCPH. The focus of my internship is the study of heterochromatin in fission yeast. Our research involves investigating the kinetics of nucleosome modifications and the dynamics of chromatin modifications using a combination of cellular and molecular biology methods, along with a theoretical foundation in the liquid-liquid phase separation theory.

Here is the results over 5000 simulations of the chromatine within 3 states :
